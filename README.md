# README

This project was done using Rails 5, and the Paperclip gem as well as some Bootstrap components.

The project was done as a pair programming exercise to present in the Friends and Family event at Wyncode on week 5.
Hats off to my colleague William Wright, whom I was fortunate enough to work with.
