# README

This project was done using Rails 5, and the Paperclip gem as well as some Bootstrap components.

The project was done using pair programming for presentation in the Friends and Family event at Wyncode on week 5.

Hats off to my colleague William Wright, whom I was fortunate enough to work with.
